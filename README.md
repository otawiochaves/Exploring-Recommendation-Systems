# Recommender Systems for Online Retail Business

Approaches such as recommendations and transaction linking to identify commonly purchased items play a crucial role in the online retail industry. Not only do they enhance the consumer experience, but they also contribute to increased revenue. This project focuses on exploring and comparing collaborative and content-based filtering techniques for recommender systems in the online retail domain.

## Dataset

The project utilizes the "Book Recommendation Datasets" available on Kaggle https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/saurabhbagchi/books-dataset These datasets contain valuable information about book recommendations, including user-read books, user-supplied reviews, and information about users who bought them. The datasets have been merged to leverage all available features in the recommendation functions. Dataset files are also uploaded here in the repository.

## Machine Learning Recommender Systems for Online Retail Business

The file "Machine Learning Recommender Systems for Online Retail Business" discusses the importance of recommender systems in the modern business environment, with a specific focus on online retail. Recommender systems play a crucial role in enhancing the user experience and increasing revenue by providing personalized suggestions to customers. The file also discusses two primary filtering methods used in recommender systems: content-based filtering and collaborative filtering. Content-based filtering focuses on analyzing the characteristics and attributes of items, while collaborative filtering leverages user behavior and preferences to make recommendations. Hybrid methods that combine both approaches are also addressed.

## Project Workflow

The project "Exploring Recommendation Systems - Enhancing Online Retail Experience and Boosting Revenues" follows the following workflow:

1. Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) and data visualization were performed to gain insights and prepare the data for the recommendation functions.

2. Text preprocessing and cleaning steps were applied to ensure high-quality data for analysis.

3. Content-based filtering was implemented using techniques such as CountVectorizer, TfidfVectorizer, and Cosine Similarity. This approach recommends books based on their textual similarities to the user's preferences.

4. A recommendation function was developed utilizing content filtering, which involves analyzing user behavior and preferences to provide tailored recommendations.

## Usage
